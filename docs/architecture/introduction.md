# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for BMad CLI Automation Tool, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

After reviewing the PRD and project brief, I can see that this is a greenfield CLI tool project with no mention of any starter templates or existing codebases. The project will be built from scratch as an NPX-distributable TypeScript CLI application.

**Decision:** N/A - No starter template will be used. This is a greenfield CLI project that will be structured as a monorepo TypeScript package designed for NPX distribution.
