# External APIs

Based on the PRD requirements and component design, this project uses the Claude TypeScript SDK for all AI agent interactions. No direct API integration is needed since we're using the official SDK.

**No external APIs require manual integration.** All AI agent communication is handled through the @anthropic-ai/sdk package, which abstracts the API details.
