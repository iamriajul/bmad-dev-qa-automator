# Next Steps

## For the Product Owner

1. Review architecture document focusing on technology choices and MVP scope
2. Validate with development team
3. Prepare for story implementation

## For the Story Manager Agent

Use this prompt to begin story creation:

```
Review the architecture document for the BMad CLI Automation Tool. Create stories for Epic 1: Foundation & Core Orchestration Engine. 

Key requirements:
- Each story must follow TDD with comprehensive test cases in acceptance criteria
- Stories should be atomic and completable in 1-2 days
- Include specific technical context from the architecture in dev notes
- Reference the tech stack versions: TypeScript 5.9.2, Node.js 22.11.0, Jest 30.0.5
- Ensure dependencies are properly mapped
```

## For the Development Team

1. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   nvm install 22.11.0
   nvm use 22.11.0
   npm install -g pnpm@9.15.0
   ```

2. Begin with Story 1.1: Project Setup with Test Infrastructure
3. Set up pre-commit hooks with Husky
4. Configure Jest 30 with TypeScript
5. Establish 90% coverage threshold
