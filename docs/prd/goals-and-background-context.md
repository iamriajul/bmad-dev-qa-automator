# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable 24/7 autonomous development by orchestrating SM-Dev-QA agent collaboration without human intervention
- Reduce agent orchestration time from 3+ hours/day to <10 minutes/day for BMad Method teams
- Achieve 4x faster feature delivery through overnight AI development cycles
- Provide clear audit trails and morning summaries of all AI agent actions
- Support dependency-aware story execution based on SM-generated dependency graphs
- Exit gracefully when SM determines no more stories are needed to complete the epic

## Background Context

Development teams using BMad Method have three capable AI agents (Story Manager, Developer, and QA) that currently sit idle for 76% of available time due to manual orchestration requirements. This CLI automation tool transforms these idle agents into a 24/7 autonomous development team by monitoring story status, launching appropriate Claude sessions, and managing context handoffs between agents. With unlimited Claude subscriptions becoming common and story-isolated contexts maintaining agent focus, the primary barrier to continuous development is the manual overhead of launching sessions and tracking progress. This tool addresses that gap, enabling teams to wake up to completed features instead of yesterday's backlog.
